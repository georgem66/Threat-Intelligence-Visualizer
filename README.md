## How to Get Started 

### Step 1: Get the Code
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Threat-Intelligence-Visualizer.git
cd Threat-Intelligence-Visualizer
```

### Step 2: Set Up the Database
1. Install PostgreSQL on your system
2. Create a new database called `threat_intelligence`
3. Note down your database credentials (username, password, host, port)

### Step 3: Configure the Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the backend folder with your settings:
```env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=threat_intelligence
DB_USERNAME=your_postgres_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_postgres_password
JWT_SECRET=make-this-a-very-long-random-string
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=development
```

Start the backend server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Set Up the Frontend
Open a new terminal window:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the frontend folder:
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api
```

Start the frontend:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 5: Access Your Application
Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5173`

**Default Login Credentials:**

- Password: `Admin123!`

## How to Use the Software üìñ

### Getting Started
1. **Login**: Use the demo credentials or create a new account
2. **Explore the Dashboard**: This is your main command center showing threat overview
3. **Check the Map**: Click on different countries to see threat details
4. **Analyze Charts**: Use the severity and category charts to understand threat patterns
5. **View Recent Activity**: See the latest threats detected by the system

### Understanding the Data
- **Threat Severity**: 
  - üî¥ Critical: Immediate action required
  - üü† High: Important threats to monitor
  - üü° Medium: Noteworthy security events
  - üü¢ Low: Minor security observations

- **Threat Categories**:
  - Malware: Malicious software and viruses
  - Phishing: Fake websites trying to steal information
  - Botnets: Networks of infected computers
  - DDoS: Attacks that overwhelm websites
  - And more!

### Advanced Features
- **Analytics Page**: Deep dive into threat trends and patterns
- **Settings**: Customize your experience and switch between themes
